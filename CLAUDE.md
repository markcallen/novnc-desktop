# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code for working in this repository.

## Repository Facts

Use this section for durable repo-specific facts that agents repeatedly need. Prefer facts stored here over re-deriving them with shell commands on every task.

Keep only stable, reviewable metadata here. Do not store secrets, credentials, or ephemeral runtime state.

- Canonical GitHub repo: `markcallen/novnc-desktop`
- Default branch: `main`
- Primary package manager: `pnpm` (v10, see `packageManager` in `package.json`)
- Version-file locations: `.nvmrc` (Node v25), `package.json` (`packageManager`)
- Canonical config files: `ansible.cfg`, `playwright.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`, `.ansible-lint`, `.yamllint`
- Primary CI workflows: `.github/workflows/lint.yml`, `.github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml`
- Primary release/publish workflows: none (private project)
- Preferred commands: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run prettier`, `pnpm test`, `ansible-lint`, `yamllint .`
- Coverage threshold: N/A (smoke/E2E tests only, no unit test coverage gate)
- Generated/protected paths (do not edit): `.smoke-state/`, `.smoke-artifacts/`, `.smoke-keys/`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `node_modules/`

Update this section when those facts change. If live runtime state is required, discover it separately instead of treating it as a durable repo fact.
