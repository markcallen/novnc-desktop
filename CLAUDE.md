# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code for working in this repository.

## Repository Facts

Use this section for durable repo-specific facts that agents repeatedly need. Prefer facts stored here over re-deriving them with shell commands on every task.

Keep only stable, reviewable metadata here. Do not store secrets, credentials, or ephemeral runtime state.

Suggested facts to record:

- Canonical GitHub repo: `<OWNER/REPO>`
- Default branch: `<main>`
- Primary package manager: `<pnpm | npm | yarn | uv | go>`
- Version-file locations agents should check first: `<.nvmrc, packageManager, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.>`
- Canonical config files: `<paths agents should read before falling back to discovery>`
- Primary CI workflows: `<workflow filenames>`
- Primary release/publish workflows: `<workflow filenames>`
- Preferred build/test/lint/format/coverage commands: `<commands>`
- Coverage threshold: `<value>`
- Generated or protected paths agents should avoid editing directly: `<paths>`

Update this section when those facts change. If live runtime state is required, discover it separately instead of treating it as a durable repo fact.
